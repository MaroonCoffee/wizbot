# Wizbot
Wizbot is a program written in Python that automates the collection of empowers in the video game Wizard101. Empowers are a valuable resource within the game that can be sold to other players for real-world currency. Therefore, the automated collection of this resource is valuable, which was the primary motivating factor for the creation of this program.

This program is not intended to be useable by others, as it only works on a Wizard101 account specially set up for the macro to function properly.

This program is a remake of the original macro I wrote in AutoHotKey. While AHK was originally sufficient for the macro, the growing complexity of the program forced the switch to Python, though the AHK library in Python is still used for many functions. 

This new and improved version runs semi-autonomously. It only needs to be checked once a day to collect the empowers it has generated and to ensure it hasn't run into a rare crash. Otherwise, the program is written such that it is robust enough to handle most unpredicted circumstances within the game.

As far as I am aware this bot complies with Wizard101's terms of service, as they do not ban the practice of botting.
